\title{Parallel paths on isogeny volcanoes}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

Let $E$ and $E'$ be two ordinary elliptic curves defined over $\F_q$,
isogenous of degree $n$, and let $\ell$ be a prime not dividing
$qn$. We denote by $\pi_E$ the Frobenius endomorphism of $E$, and by
$\pi_{E'}$ the one of $E'$; when there is no ambiguity, we simply
write $\pi$. Because the two curves are isogenous, their Frobenius
morphisms are annihilated by the same quadratic polynomial
\[\pi^2 - t\pi + q.\]

Define $d_\pi=t^2-4q$, and let $K=\Q[\sqrt{d_\pi}]$. The endomorphism
ring of $E$ is isomorphic to an order $\O_E$ such that
$\Z[\pi]\subset\O_E\subset\O_K$, where $O_K$ is the ring of integers
of $K$. Write $d_\pi=f^2d_K$ with $d_K$ squarefree, then
$[\O_K:\Z[\pi]]=f$ is the conductor of $\Z[\pi]$, and the conductor of
$\O_E$ must divide $f$.

Because of the hypothesis, the conductors of $\O_E$ and $\O_{E'}$ must
have the same $\ell$-adic valuation.


It is well known that elliptic curves up to isomorphism, together with
isogenies of degree $\ell$, for a multigraph, called $\ell$-isogeny
volcano. The height of the volcano is equal to half the $\ell$-adic
valuation of the discriminant,
